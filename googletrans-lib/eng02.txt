Eric Trump sounded triumphant after Florida officials recently approved giving away a prized piece of Miami real estate for his father’s presidential library. “I got the library approved yesterday,” Trump said on a podcast, adding that “we just got the greatest site in Florida and I’m going to be building that.”

Then, speaking on another program, Trump said he would take the host’s suggestion to create a “fake news wing” — paid for with money from lawsuit settlements with ABC, CBS and other sources. It would run clips from “60 Minutes” and other programs that he said were evidence of the media organizations’ animus against his father.
